This project demonstrates a simple and practical example of using a React portal to do something interesting.

Portals are an awesome feature released with React v16 that give developers massive flesibility
when working with DOM elements. They allow us treat control and manage a DOM element as though
it were a direct child of some component ... but actually render it outside of that component's
DOM hierarchy.

I have used Portals in lots of places in various projects to great effect and wanted to share my learning
with others.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).
